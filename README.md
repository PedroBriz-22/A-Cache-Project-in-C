# Cache Simulator in C

This project is a **cache memory simulator** written in C.  
It simulates cache behavior by processing memory traces and reporting cache performance.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Simulates cache accesses from trace files
- Tracks hits, misses, and miss rates
- Modular C implementation for clarity

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **Language:** C  
- **Tools:** GCC, VS Code  

---

## üìÇ Files
- **Main.c** ‚Äî source code for the cache simulator  
- **trace.txt** ‚Äî sample memory access trace  
- *(Executable `Main.exe` is excluded, compile manually as shown below)*
